I am a Software Engineering Intern at BlackRock and am a Senior Computer Science major at Rutgers University.

I always love learning new technologies so always feel free to message or contact me about anything software related!
Otherwise, I am always free to talk about interesting ideas and love gaining insight into different areas, even if it may not
be fully into software by itself.

I am currently interested in Software Engineering roles as well as Data Science roles, but I am willing to take any path that
comes my way that may excite me.
